# Modern Like System (scaffold)

Scaffolded full-stack React (Vite) frontend and Express backend.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies for server and client:

```bash
npm run install-all
```

2. Start development servers:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend: `server` runs on port 4000 by default. Frontend: `client` runs on 5173.

Next steps:
- Implement UI components to match the reference site.
- Integrate a vehicle-history data provider or scraper (requires API access).
